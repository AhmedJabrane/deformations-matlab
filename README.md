# Deformation analytical models

## Summary

Some basic analytical models to compute surface deformations in elastic half-space. All codes are pure Matlab/Octave vectorized language.

### Mogi [1958]
Point source in elastic half-space, approximation for sphere of radius a &lt;&lt; f (displacements, tilt and strain at surface).

### Sun [1969]
Penny-shaped crack in elastic half-space, approximation for h/a >> 1 (displacements at surface).

### Okada [1985]
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space (displacements, tilt and strain at surface).

### Okubo [1992]
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space (gravity and elevation change at surface).
