# Deformation analytical models summary

Some basic analytical models to compute surface deformations in elastic half-space.

### Mogi [1958]
Point source in elastic half-spacei, approximation for sphere of radius a &lt;&lt; f (displacements, tilt and strain at surface)
### Sun [1969]
Penny-shaped crack in elastic half-space (approximation for h/a >> 1)
### Okada [1985]
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space (displacements, tilt and strain at surface)
### Okubo [1992]
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space (gravity and elevation change at surface)
